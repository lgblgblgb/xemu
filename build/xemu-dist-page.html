<h1>Temporary Xemu Distribution/Demonstration page</h1>

<p id="javascriptwarning">You must enable javascript to be able to use this page.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a id="ref1" href="dist/xemu-sample.html"><b>In-browser demonstration of Xemu emulators</b></a>
		<p><i>The same source code what native (ie, Windows, or Linux executable) version of Xemu is built from, just
		built with a compiler named "emscripten", which makes it possible to generatre "web-aware" result (WebAssembly, asm.js).
		This is a <b>highly work in progress</b> version, you can see ugly, and partially broken user interface (among other problems), and
		it requires fairly modern browser, possibly (latest version of) Firefox or Chrome (even Safari is too old, it seems, no hope
		for IE too much, of course, or anything MS ... Maybe Edge with the Blink rendering engine which is not even released yet officially ..).
		Beware, it causes quite huge data download when
		visiting this page, around 20Mbyte or such in case of Mega65 emulator for example. This version also includes a mostly working setup to really see Xemu/Mega65 in action
		(prepared SD-card image, etc).</i></p>
	</li>

	<li><b>Download experimental NSIS installer of Xemu for Microsoft(TM) Windows:</b>
	<p><b><a id="ref2" href="dist/install-xemu-win64.exe">Installer for 64 bit Windows</a></b><script>document.write(getfileinfo("install-xemu-win64.exe"));</script><br>
	   <b><a id="ref3" href="dist/install-xemu-win32.exe">Installer for 32 bit Windows</a></b><script>document.write(getfileinfo("install-xemu-win32.exe"));</script></p>
		<p><i><b>Experimental</b> installer of Xemu for Windows using NullSoft's install shield ("NSIS").
		Please use the 64 bit version, unless you have a 32 bit OS from the stone age.
		Note: you probably need Windows 10 (earlier Windows versions are kinda lame from programmer's view point,
		Microsoft started to implement sane programming APIs in Windows 10 ...). Besides of the installer, you <b>still need to
		manually provide the needed non-free components, eg ROM images, SD-card image ...</b>.</i></p>
		<p><b><i>WARNING: according to a report, some antivirus software detects NSIS installer as a trojan/virus. I can't be <u>totally</u> sure on this since
		I only use NSIS as the installer, though I strongly believe at least, it's just
		a false positive. <a href="https://nsis.sourceforge.io/NSIS_False_Positives">Here it is some description from Nullsoft itself about this - unfortunately - quite common problem</a>.</i></b>
		<i>In case of doubts, you can still try the ZIP'ed version without an installer (see below).</i>
		</p>
	</li>

	<li><b>Download only the binaries of Xemu for Microsoft(TM) Windows:</b>
	<p><b><a id="ref4" href="dist/xemu-win64-binaries.zip">ZIP archive for 64 bit Windows</a></b><script>document.write(getfileinfo("xemu-win64-binaries.zip"));</script><br>
	   <b><a id="ref5" href="dist/xemu-win32-binaries.zip">ZIP archive for 32 bit Windows</a></b><script>document.write(getfileinfo("xemu-win32-binaries.zip"));</script></p>
	   <p><i>
	   	ZIP archive, with only the needed EXE + DLL files, but without any installer. Can be usefull for more advanced Windows users. Please use the 64 bit version, unless you
		really have a 32 bit OS from the stone age.
	   </i></p>
	</li>

	<li><b><a id="ref6" href="dist/xemu_current_amd64.deb">Download: experimental, DEB package of Xemu (done on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS, 64 bit)</a></b><script>document.write(getfileinfo("xemu_current_amd64.deb"));</script>

		<p><i>Debian package built from Xemu on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS, 64 bit version. <b>Bonus:</b> you can try to
		run command <code>xemu-download-data</code> (as root, so probably with <code>sudo</code>) to fetch some ROMs,
		emulators included in Xemu need, but note; this is your own legal/whatever risk to do so! Note, even that, it won't
		give you the SD-card image for the Mega65 emulator of Xemu unfortunately, currently.
		</i></p>
	</li>

	<li><b><a id="ref7" href="dist/xemu-current-1.x86_64.rpm">Download: really experimental RPM package (64 bit)</a></b><script>document.write(getfileinfo("xemu-current-1.x86_64.rpm"));</script>

		<p><i>Simply a converted version (with the tool 'alien') of the DEB package above. So it's highly possible it won't work on any RPM based Linux
		distrubitions, I have no idea at all :(
		</i></p>
	</li>

	<li><b><a href="https://github.com/lgblgblgb/xemu">Source code, GIT repository of Xemu</a></b>
		<p><i>You should focus mostly on the "dev" branch here ...</i></p>
	</li>

	<li><b>Where is the MacOS pre-built version?</b>
		<p><i>Not so much here ... Unfortunately Apple makes it hard or even impossible to ship free software to their OS, ie they require me to buy a Mac ...
		Other solutions (including using cross compiler) still does not work, since it depends on non-free components, ie XCode to be installed, and such ...
		For Windows (which I don't have either) you can have cross-compilers without the need of any Microsoft-material to be able to work at least.
		If you are expert in this area, and you have an idea, please do not keep it yourself :) Thanks.

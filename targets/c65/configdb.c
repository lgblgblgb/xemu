/* Important WARNING:
 * This is a trap! If you have something here with '#ifdef', it's quite possible that the macro is
 * not defined here, but defined elsewhere, thus the emulator sees totally different structs for
 * real but the problem is hidden! That is, be very careful at configdb_st (the type definition
 * itself also at the usage!) that should be only dependent on macros defined in xemu-target.h,
 * since that header file is always included by the build system, at command line level. */

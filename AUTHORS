X-Emulators - aka "Xemu" - (C)2016-2021 LGB Gábor Lénárt lgblgblgb@gmail.com

Major direct contributors of the project:

  * Hernán Di Pietro <hernan.di.pietro@gmail.com> (major works: MacOS GUI code, MEGA65 VIC-IV refinements)

Other than my (or "our", see about contributors) own work, Xemu uses:

  * SDL2 (externally linked, not in Xemu, but it's always nice to give the credit)
  * Heavily modified (by me) Z80ex, original project: https://sourceforge.net/projects/z80ex/
  * Modified version of "WebSid" which seems to be from "TinySID for Linux": https://github.com/wothke/websid
  * LodePNG: https://lodev.org/lodepng/
  * Nuked-OPL3: https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-OPL3

Help from other people (maybe not a full list, sorry about that), I would like to thank:

  * Paul Gardner-Stephen: for tons of help on answering my questions and problems with Commodore 65 and MEGA65,
    so I could start to emulate them (and also for creating GS65/MEGA65 at all, btw)
  * Hernán Di Pietro: other than being a direct contributor, also helped in testing Xemu, sharing his
    opinion and suggestions, and things like these
  * Snoopy on Forum64: for many tests (C65/MEGA65), bug reports
